         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>This Deſcription of its Scituation I perſwade my ſelf, Cozen puts you unto a little fit of longing to know by what means our Country-men came at firſt to make themſelves Maſter of a place ſo naturally fortified; And truly in diſcovering that, we ſhall acquaint you with a ſtratagem excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling moſt you ſhall meet with in the Greek and Roman Hiſtories and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualled by few of thoſe in the Low Countrey Wars, or any more mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern expeditions.</p>

               <!-- PDF PAGE 112 -->Commodities the people ſuffered 3 or 4 of their Crew to Land, and traded with them with much Amity for a day or two. At laſt having inſinuated into the good opinion of the credulous Iſlanders They told them having been a long Trading Voyage in the <hi>Streights</hi> their Maſter was ſome time ſince dead, but had engaged them not to expoſe his Corps into the Ocean to be devoured of the Fiſh, but to Interr it with Chriſtian Burial in the next place where they ſhould touch ground, and therefore they deſired that Chriſtian favour of them that they might lay him in their Church-yard, coming only ſome few of them on Shore without any Arms to perform the Ceremony; The unwary people conſent, and our Captain with about 20 of his ſtoureſt Men with a Coffin and much ſeeming ſolemnity get a Shore; The Natives aſſiſting them to get their <hi>Trojan</hi> Horſe up the Precipice; but no ſooner were they arrived at the Church, but clapping to the Doors as if they had ſome private devotions to celebrate at which the inhabitants might not be preſent, They break open their Coffin filled inſtead of a dead body with Inſtruments of Death, and inſtantly arming themſelves ſlay that ſmall <hi>French</hi> Guard that there offered reſiſtance, and retiring to the Landing place ſecure that, get in more of their company, and in 5 hours time without the loſs of one Man, made themſelves Maſters of the whole Iſland, which ever ſince that time has had the Honour to boaſt it ſelf part of the Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Engliſh Crown.</p>
            <p>But ſince nothing is more neceſſary to the Life of Man, than thoſe four Elements whereof He together with the reſt of the Univerſe is originally compoſed. I ſhall in the next place obſerve how we are therewith ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comodated.</p>
            <p>Our Air conſidering the narrowneſs of the place, and how 'tis encompaſſed with the Ocean Is much better then can be expected, our Heaven ſerene, and our Sky generally free from that naſty diſh-clout of Fogs and Clouds which in your Mariſhes and City too are wont to mufflle up the Suns glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious face, In brief tis ſo agreeable to nature, That although I know not one Phyſitian in the Iſland (and perhaps we live the longer for their abſence) yet to meet here a hearty old man of fourſcore is nothing rare or infrequent.</p>
            <p>Our water I confeſs is ſometimes not very ready, and yet we have in the Iſland no leſs than ſix very fine ſprings generally running, Whoſe water pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified in its under-ground paſſage, and by being drawn ſo high through Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures Limbeck, Bubbles up ſo free from any ſmack of Brackiſhneſs, that it may compare with your Lambs-Conduit, and for ought I know is no leſs miraculous for curing ſore Eyes than <hi>Crowders</hi> Well.</p>
            <p>Our Earth or Soil Is for the moſt part hot and ſandy, yet fruitful enough
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:36754:5"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 113 -->to afford all neceſſeries to its Inhabitants, excellent for bearing all kind of Roots, As Parſneps, Carrots; Turneps, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And very well ſtored with fruit-trees (for the moſt part planted of late by the good Husbandry of the people) Furniſhing us with Syder not at all inferiour to your <hi>Herefordſhire</hi> Redſtreak, and to render it the more wholeſome tis generally boyled with a little ſpice, which preſerves it and gives it an incomparable Relliſh; Corn we have of moſt ſorts, but not in any extraordinary quantity; our paſture is but ſhort yet exceeding ſweet and therefore we have rare Mutton, but no great plenty of Beef, and Cows only enow to ſupply us with Milk and Butter, for our Cheeſe we have generally from <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our Fireing (to ſpeak of the moſt aſpiring Element laſt) Is for the moſt part Furzes and ſometimes Turf, For we have but little wood, and no Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber at all growing throughout the whole Iſland; ſo that we are forced either to make ſhift with old Apple-tree for our Houſes, or furniſh our ſelves as well as we can with Deal.</p>
            <p>For Belly-timber our 3 ſtaple Commodities are Fiſh, Fowl and Rabbets. Of the firſt a little Induſtry will purchaſe us a hundred ſorts, particularly a large Fiſh we call a Vrack-fiſh which we ſplit, and nailing it to our Walls dry it in the Sun for part of our Winter proviſion; As alſo a large ſhel-fiſh taken plentifully at Low-tides called an Ormond that ſticks to the Rocks, whence we beat them off with a Foſel or Iron hook; Tis much bigger then an Oyſter, and like that good either freſh or pickled; but infinitely more pleaſant to the Guſto, ſo that an epicure would think his pallat in Paradice if he might but always gormondize on ſuch delitious <hi>Ambroſia,</hi> To borrow <hi>Aretines</hi> phraſe upon his eating a Lamprey.</p>
            <p>For Fowl your City cannot be better furniſht with Wood-cocks or Widgeons, beſides the abundance of Duck, Mallard, Teal and other wild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fowl, with Clift-Pidgeons with which at ſome ſeaſons almoſt the whole Iſland is covered.</p>
